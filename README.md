# NetappDiskCleaner

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/ONTAP-9.7-brightgreen.svg)

# About
This program was built to clean any data and metadata that are left on disks used by Netapp systems. It connects to the ONTAP Cluster using SSH and runs a set of commands in a certain order to clean any data/metadata that is left on the disk so that it can be used in another system.

# Remarks
- Currently the program was tested only on ONTAP 9.7
- Use the program at your own risk, I'm not responsible on any occasion of data loss that might be happening to your system.
